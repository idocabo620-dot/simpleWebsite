      <h2>Industry Overview</h2>
      <div class="section-box">
        <p>
          The beauty industry includes skincare, makeup, hair care, and fragrance brands.
          Many companies sell products online and use social media, loyalty programs, and
          customer accounts to grow their business. These companies collect customer data
          such as names, emails, shipping addresses, and purchase history.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2>Career of Interest</h2>
      <div class="section-box">
        <p>
          A career that interests me in the beauty industry is a
          <strong>digital marketing specialist</strong>. This job focuses on promoting products
          online using social media and websites, while analyzing customer behavior to improve
          advertising strategies.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2>Ethical Issue That Could Arise</h2>
      <div class="section-box">
        <p>
          An ethical issue in this career is misleading advertising, such as exaggerating product
          results or using heavily edited photos. This can create unrealistic expectations and
          pressure customers into buying products that may not work as promised.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2>How My Personal Values Shape My Response</h2>
      <div class="section-box">
        <p>
          My values of integrity and responsibility would guide me to promote products honestly.
          Respect for others means not taking advantage of customer insecurities. Continuous
          learning helps me stay informed about ethical marketing standards.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2>Cybersecurity Issues in the Beauty Industry</h2>
      <div class="section-box">
        <p>
          Beauty companies are targets for cyberattacks because they handle online payments and
          customer accounts. Issues may include phishing attacks, stolen login credentials,
          malware on checkout pages, and data leaks from third-party vendors.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2>Cybersecurity Best Practices</h2>
      <div class="section-box">
        <p>
          Best practices include encrypting customer data, using multi-factor authentication,
          securing payment systems, keeping websites updated, and training employees to recognize
          cyber threats.
