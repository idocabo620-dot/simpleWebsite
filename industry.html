      <h2>Industry Overview</h2>
      <div class="section-box">
        <p>
          The beauty industry includes skincare, makeup, hair care, and fragrance brands.
          Many beauty companies sell products online and in stores while also using social media,
          influencers, loyalty programs, and customer accounts to build long-term relationships.
          Because of online shopping and customer profiles, beauty companies often collect personal
          information such as names, emails, shipping addresses, and purchase history.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2>Career of Interest</h2>
      <div class="section-box">
        <p>
          A career that interests me in the beauty industry is a <strong>digital marketing specialist</strong>.
          This job focuses on promoting products online through social media, email marketing, and website content.
          It also involves analyzing customer behavior to understand what customers like and how to improve
          campaigns and sales.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2>Ethical Issue That Could Arise</h2>
      <div class="section-box">
        <p>
          An ethical issue that could arise in digital marketing is <strong>misleading advertising</strong>.
          For example, a brand might over-edit photos, hide product limitations, or exaggerate results
          (like promising that a skincare product will “erase acne overnight”).
          This could pressure customers to buy something based on unrealistic expectations.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2>How My Personal Values Shape My Response</h2>
      <div class="section-box">
        <p>
          My personal values guide how I would respond. With <strong>integrity</strong>, I would want marketing
          to be honest and clear. With <strong>respect</strong>, I would consider how ads affect people’s confidence
          and self-image. With <strong>responsibility</strong>, I would speak up if a campaign is misleading.
          With <strong>continuous learning</strong>, I would keep learning better ways to market products ethically
          while still meeting business goals.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2>Cybersecurity Issues in the Beauty Industry</h2>
      <div class="section-box">
        <p>
          Beauty companies are common targets because they process payments and store customer accounts.
          Some cybersecurity issues that could occur include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Phishing</strong> attacks tricking employees or customers into giving passwords.</li>
          <li><strong>Credential stuffing</strong> when attackers reuse leaked passwords to access accounts.</li>
          <li><strong>Checkout skimming</strong> malware that steals card numbers during payment.</li>
          <li><strong>Fake websites</strong> pretending to be a real beauty brand to steal data.</li>
          <li><strong>Third-party vendor breaches</strong> through payment, shipping, or marketing tools.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h2>Cybersecurity Best Practices in This Industry</h2>
      <div class="section-box">
        <p>
          Beauty companies can reduce risk by using strong cybersecurity best practices such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Encrypting customer data</strong> so it’s protected if stolen.</li>
          <li><strong>Multi-factor authentication (MFA)</strong> for employee and admin logins.</li>
          <li><strong>Secure payment processing</strong> and keeping checkout systems updated.</li>
          <li><strong>Regular patching</strong> of website software and plugins.</li>
          <li><strong>Access control</strong> so employees only see the data they truly need.</li>
          <li><strong>Security training</strong> to reduce phishing and social engineering success.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
